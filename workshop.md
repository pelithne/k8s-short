# 1. Kubernetes Workshop

This workshop/tutorial contains a number of different sections, each addressing a specific aspect of running workloads (containers) in Kubernetes in Azure.

You will go through the following steps to complete the workshop:

* Use Azure Portal and Azure Cloud Shell
* Setup Azure Container Registry to build and store docker images
* Create Kubernetes Cluster using AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
* Deploy and expose applications
* Upgrading kuberenetes version of a cluster
* Use Secret in AKS
* Mounting storage in AKS â€‹


# 2. Prerequisites

## 2.1. Azure Portal

To make sure you are correctly setup with a working subscription, make sure you can log in to the Azure portal. Go to <https://portal.azure.com> Once logged in, feel free to browse around a little bit to get to know the surroundings!

It might be a good idea to keep a tab with the Azure Portal open during the workshop, to keep track of the Azure resources you create. We will only use CLI based tools during the workshop, but everything will be visible in the portal, and all the resources we create could also be created using the portal.

## 2.2. Azure Cloud Shell

We will use the Azure Cloud Shell throughout the workshop for all our command line needs. This is a web based shell that has all the necessary tools (like kubectl, az cli, helm, etc) pre-installed.

Start cloud shell by typing the address ````shell.azure.com```` into a web browser. If you have not used cloud shell before, you will be asked to create a storage location for cloud shell. Accept that and make sure that you run bash as your shell (not powershell).

**Protip: You can use ctrl-c to copy text in cloud shell. To paste you have to use shift-insert, or use the right mouse button -> paste. If you are on a Mac, you can use the "normal" Cmd+C/Cmd+V.**

**Protip II: Cloud Shell will time out after 20 minutes of inactivity. When you log back in, you will end up in your home directory, so be sure to ````cd```` into where you are supposed to be.**

## 2.3. Subscription
You need a valid Azure subscription. To use a specific subscription, use the ````account```` command like this (with your subscription id):
````
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
````

# 3. Initial Setup

## 3.1. Get the code

The code for this workshop is located in the same repository that you are looking at now. To *clone* the repository to your cloud shell, do this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pelithne/k8s-short.git
```

Then cd into the repository directory:

````bash
cd k8s-short
````

## 3.2. View the code

Azure Cloud Shell has a built in code editor, which is based on the popular VS Code editor. To view/edit all the files in the repository, run code like this:

````bash
code .
````

You can navigate the files in the repo in the left hand menu, and edit the files in the right hand window. Use the *right mouse button* to access the various commands (e.g. ````Save```` and ````Quit```` etc).

For instance, you may want to have a look in the ````application/azure-vote-app```` directory. This is where the code for the application is located. Here you can also find the *Dockerfile* which will be used to build your docker image, in a later step.

## 3.3. Create Resource Group

All resources in Azure exists in a *Resource Group*. The resource group is a "placeholder" for all the resources you create. 

All the resources you create in this workshop will use the same Resource Group. Use the commnd below to create the resource group.

````bash
az group create -n <resource-group-name> -l westeurope
````

## 3.4. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)

You will use a private Azure Container Registry to *build* and *store* the docker images that you will deploy to Kubernetes. The name of the the ACR needs to be globally unique, and should consist of only lower case letters. You could for instance use your corporate signum.

The reason it needs to be unique, is that your ACR will get a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), on the form ````<Your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io````

The command below will create the container registry and place it in the Resource Group you created previously.

````bash
az acr create --name <your unique ACR name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --sku basic
````

## 3.5. Build images using ACR

Docker images can be built in a number of different ways, for instance by using the docker CLI. Another (and sometimes easier) way is to use *Azure Container Registry Tasks*, which is the approach we will use in this workshop.

The docker image is built using a so called *Dockerfile*. The Dockerfile contains instructions for how to build the image. Feel free to have a look at the Dockerfile in the repository (once again using *code*):

````bash
code application/azure-vote-app/Dockerfile
````

As you can see, this very basic Dockerfile will use a *base image* from ````tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.6-alpine3.8````.

On top of that base image, it will install [redis-py](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) and then take the contents of the directory ````./azure-vote```` and copy it into the container in the path ````/app````.

To build the docker container image, cd into the right directory, and use the ````az acr build```` command:

````bash
cd application/azure-vote-app
az acr build --image azure-vote-front:v1 --registry <your unique ACR name> --file Dockerfile .
````

## 3.6. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

AKS is the hosted Kubernetes service on Azure.

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. You build and deploy your own applications into a Kubernetes cluster, and let the cluster manage the availability and connectivity. In this step a sample application will be deployed into your own Kubernetes cluster. You will learn how to:

* Create an AKS Kubernetes Cluster
* Connect/validate towards the AKS Cluster
* Update Kubernetes manifest files
* Run an application in Kubernetes

### 3.6.1. Create AKS Cluster

Create an AKS cluster using ````az aks create````. Give the cluster a name, e.g.  ````k8s````, and run the command:

```azurecli
az aks create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name k8s --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v4 --no-ssh-key --attach-acr <your unique ACR name>
```

### note: in the command above, we attach the ACR created previously. This is to allow the AKS cluster to download images from the container registry. Behind the scenes, this is using Azure Managed Identity.

The creation time for the cluster should be around 5 minutes.

### 3.6.2. Get access to the AKS Cluster

In order to use `kubectl` you need to connect to the Kubernetes cluster, using the following command (which assumes that you named the cluster k8s):

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name k8s
```

To verify that your cluster is up and running you can try a kubectl command, like ````kubectl get nodes```` which  will show you the nodes (virtual machines) that are active in your cluster. If you followed the instructions, you should see two nodes.

````bash
kubectl get nodes
````


### 3.6.3. Update a Kubernetes manifest file

You have built a docker image with the sample application, in the Azure Container Registry (ACR). To deploy the application to Kubernetes, you must update the image name in the Kubernetes manifest file to include the ACR name. Currently the manifest "points" to a container located in a microsoft repository.

The file to modify is located in the ````./k8s-short/application/azure-vote-app```` directory.

Open this manifest file with a text editor, such as `code`:

```bash
cd application/azure-vote-app
code azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
```

Replace the *microsoft* server with your Azure Container Registry. The following example shows the original content and how you need to modify it.

Original:

```yaml
containers:
- name: azure-vote-front
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/azure-vote-front:v2
```

Provide the ACR login server you created before, so that your manifest file looks like the following example:

```yaml
containers:
- name: azure-vote-front
  image: <your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
```

Please also take some time to study the manifest file, to get a better understanding of what it contains.

Right click Save and then right click Quit.

### 3.6.4. Deploy the application

To deploy your application, use the ```kubectl apply``` command. This command parses the manifest file and creates the needed Kubernetes objects. Specify the sample manifest file, as shown in the following example:

```console
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
```

When the manifest is applied, a pod and a service is created. The pod contains the "business logic" of your application and the service exposes the application to the internet.  

To monitor the progress of the deployment, you can use ``kubectl get pods``, like this:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You can also use ``kubectl describe`` to trouble shoot any problems you might have with the deployment (for instance, a common problem is **Error: ErrImagePull**, which can be caused by incorrect credentials or incorrect address/path to the container in ACR. It can also happen if the Kubernetes Cluster does not have read permission in the Azure Container Registry.

Once your container has been pulled and started, showing state **READY**, you can instead start monitoring the **service** to see when a public IP address has been created.

To monitor progress, use the `kubectl get service`. You will probably have to repeats a few times, as it can take a while to get the public IP address.

```console
kubectl get service azure-vote-front
```

The *EXTERNAL-IP* for the *azure-vote-front* service initially appears as *pending*, as shown in the following example:

```bash
azure-vote-front   10.0.34.242   <pending>     80:30676/TCP   7s
```

When the *EXTERNAL-IP* address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, the creation of the service is finished. The following example shows a public IP address is now assigned:

```bash
azure-vote-front   10.0.34.242   52.179.23.131   80:30676/TCP   2m
```

To see the application in action, open a web browser to the external IP address.

### 3.6.5. Update an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

After an application has been deployed in Kubernetes, it can be updated by specifying a new container image or image version. When doing so, the update is staged so that only a portion of the deployment is concurrently updated. This staged update enables the application to keep running during the update. It also provides a rollback mechanism if a deployment failure occurs.

In this step the sample Azure Vote app is updated. You learn how to:

* Update the front-end application code
* Create an updated container image
* Deploy the updated container image to AKS

### 3.6.6. Increase number of pods

Let's make a change to the sample application, then update the version already deployed to your AKS cluster. 

First we want to make sure that the update can be completed without service interruption. For this to be possible, we need multiple instances of the front end pod. This will enable Kubernetes to update the app as a "rolling update", which means that it will restart the pods in sequence making sure that one or more is always running.

To achieve that, open the sample manifest file `azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml` and change the number of replicas of the ````azure-vote-front```` pod from 1 to 3, on line 34 (or similar).

````bash
code azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

Change

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  replicas: 1
```

to

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

To activate the new configuration, use ````kubectl apply```` in cloud shell:

````bash
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

Now you can verify the number of running front-end instances with the ```kubectl get pods``` command:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-769d45cfcb-gk496    1/1     Running   0          51m
azure-vote-front-74b865bcd9-52xkm   1/1     Running   0          49s
azure-vote-front-74b865bcd9-94lrz   1/1     Running   0          49s
azure-vote-front-74b865bcd9-xfsq8   1/1     Running   0          18m
```

### 3.6.7. Update the application

The sample application source code can be found inside of the *azure-vote* directory. Open the *config_file.cfg* file with an editor, such as `code`:

```bash
code azure-vote/config_file.cfg
```

Change the values for *VOTE1VALUE* and *VOTE2VALUE* to different colors. The following example shows the updated color values:

```bash
# UI Configurations
TITLE = 'Azure Voting App'
VOTE1VALUE = 'Blue'
VOTE2VALUE = 'Purple'
SHOWHOST = 'false'
```

Save and close the file.

### 3.6.8. Update the container image

To build a new front-end image, use ```az acr build``` the same way as before, but make sure to change the version from ````v1```` to ````v2````

```bash
az acr build --image azure-vote-front:v2 --registry <your unique ACR name> --file Dockerfile .
```

This will build a new container image, with the code changes you did in the previous step. The image will be stored in ACR with the same name as before, but with a new version (v2).

You can check that all went well with the ````az acr repository show-tags```` command:

````bash
az acr repository show-tags --name <Your ACR Name> --repository azure-vote-front --output table
````

### 3.6.9. Deploy the updated application

To update the application, you can use  ```kubectl set``` and specify the new application version, but the preferred way is to edit the kubernetes manifest to change the version:

Open the file ````azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml```` again and change ````image:```` from ````<Your ACR Name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1```` to ````<Your ACR Name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v2```` on line 47 (or close to 47...).

Change

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <Your ACR Name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
```

To

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <Your ACR Name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v2
```

And then run:

````bash
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

Note in the output of the command, how only the azure-vote-front deployment is *configured* while the others are *unchanged*. This is because the changes made to the manifest only impacts the azure-vote-front deployment. In other words, only the necessary things are changed, while the rest is left untouched.

````bash
deployment.apps/azure-vote-back unchanged
service/azure-vote-back unchanged
deployment.apps/azure-vote-front configured
service/azure-vote-front unchanged
````

To monitor the deployment, use the ```kubectl get pods``` command. As the updated application is deployed, your pods are terminated and re-created with the new container image.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The following example output shows pods terminating and new instances running as the deployment progresses:

```bash
kubectl get pods

NAME                               READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-2978095810-gq9g0   1/1       Running       0          5m
azure-vote-front-1297194256-tpjlg  1/1       Running       0          1m
azure-vote-front-1297194256-tptnx  1/1       Running       0          5m
azure-vote-front-1297194256-zktw9  1/1       Terminating   0          1m
```

### 3.6.10. Test the updated application

To view the updated application, first get the external IP address of the `azure-vote-front` service (will be the same as before, since the service was not updated, only the pod):

```console
kubectl get service azure-vote-front
```

Now open a local web browser to the IP address.

### 3.6.11 cluster upgrade
Upgrading an AKS cluster is pretty straight forward, in its basic form. If you want to learn more details, feel free to have a look here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster

To show the current kubernetes version in your cluster:

````
az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name k8s --query "kubernetesVersion"
````
### note: there is actually a little bit more to it, because nodepools can have different versions, but for our current case this is good enough.

Upgrades can only be done to newer versions (downgrades are not possible). To check which versions are available in your region and which versions have eligible upgrades, please run the following command:

```bash
az aks get-versions --location westeurope --output table
```

It will output a table similar to
```
KubernetesVersion    Upgrades
-------------------  -----------------------
1.25.4               None available
1.25.2               1.25.4
1.24.6               1.25.2, 1.25.4
1.24.3               1.24.6, 1.25.2, 1.25.4
1.23.12              1.24.3, 1.24.6
1.23.8               1.23.12, 1.24.3, 1.24.6
```

From this output you can derive what upgrades are available for your particular cluster version

For example, to upgrade your cluster to version ````1.25.2```` just run the following command:
````
az aks upgrade --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name k8s --kubernetes-version 1.25.2
````



### 3.7 Secret management in AKS
### Note: The exercise below is using standard Kubernetes secrets. This is not recommended from a security point of view, but the idea here is to introduce the concept. There are things you can/should do to increase security later on.

### 3.7.1 create secret

Create files that will be used as input to the secret, and echo some text strings into the files. 

```bash
$ echo -n "user" > ./user.txt
$ echo -n "verysecretpassword" > ./pass.txt
```

Use kubectl create secret to generate a secret using the files just created

```bash
kubectl create secret generic credentials --from-file=./user.txt --from-file=./pass.txt
```

Check to see that your secret has been created

```bash
kubectl get secrets
```


### 3.7.2 Use the secret
For this example, we will insert the secret into environment variables in a pod. For convenience we will continue to use the azure-vote container.

To use the secret in the pod, you need to edit the manifest in `azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml` once again. At the end of the ````Deployment```` section for ````azure-vote-front```` Change the following:
````
      env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
````

To look like this
````    
      env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
        - name: USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: user.txt
        - name: PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: pass.txt
````

After this, just re-apply the configuration 

````
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

After a few moments, you should be able to log into the pod and check the environment variables. Use the following commands to ````exec```` into the container.

First get the name of the pod
````
kubectl get pods
````

You should see two pods. One of them will be named something like ````azure-vote-front-d94895c88-p52sr````. This is the pod you want to access.

Use ````kubectl exec -it <name of the pod> -- sh```` to access the pod (make sure to replace the pod name with the name of your pod):

````
kubectl exec -it azure-vote-front-d94895c88-p52sr -- sh
````

Once inside the pod, list the environment variables in the pod with the ````printenv```` command

````
printenv
````

This will give you a long list of environment variables. You should be able to find the username and password variables you created.

Alternatively, you can achive the same result with a one-liner:

````
kubectl exec -it azure-vote-front-d94895c88-p52sr -- printenv
````


To exit the container, just type:
````
exit
````




## 3.8 Storage options in AKS

### 3.8.1 Dynamically create volume using Azure Disk

The easiest way to create persistant storage for a pod in AKS is to use the dynamic option. In this exercise you will be using one of the built in storage classes, to make it even easier.

The first thing you need to do is to create a Persistant Volume Claim (PVC). In order to do that, you can create a file with the kubernetes manifest for a PVC.

Create a file named azure-pvc.yaml, with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: managed-csi
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

Then create the PVC using the ````kubectl apply```` command:

````
kubectl apply -f azure-pvc.yaml
````

Next step is to use the PVC in a pod. For simplicity, we will keep using the same manifest as before. 

Edit ````azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml```` to add the ````volume```` and ````volumeMounts```` sections. 

Before:

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
        - name: USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: user.txt
        - name: PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: pass.txt

```

After (in other words, add the volumeMount at the end of the ````containers```` section and add the ````volumes```` section at the same indentation level as the ````containers```` section).

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
        volumeMounts:
        - name: disk
          mountPath: "/mnt/azuredisk"
        env:
        - name: REDIS
          value: "azure-vote-back"
        - name: USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: user.txt
        - name: PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: credentials
              key: pass.txt
      volumes:
      - name: disk
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: azure-managed-disk
```

### Note: Make sure indentation is correct. YAML is really picky when it comes to that. The ````volumes```` statement should be on the same indentation level as the ````containers```` statement

Now, re-apply the pod definition using the ````kubectl apply```` command:

````
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

To check that the storage was created, you can exec into the pod and run the ````ls```` command:

````
kubectl -it <name of the pod> -- sh
ls -l /mnt/azuredisk
````


### 3.8.2 If you have the time: Use a file share as a volume, this time with static mode

If you need storage that can be accessed by all pods in a cluster, you can use Azure Files. You can create the file share dynamically, like in the previous example, or statically. In this exercise you will take the hard way, and create it statically. 

Create storage account. Give the storage account a unique name (e.g. use your signum)
````
az storage account create -n <unique name for storage account> -g <resource-group-name> -l westeurope  --sku Standard_LRS
````


Export the storage account connection string as an environment variable, this will be used when creating the Azure file share

````
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string -n <unique name for storage account> -g <resource-group-name> -o tsv)
````

Create the file share, inside the storage account. The fileshare could be named e.g. "aksshare"

````
az storage share create -n <file share name> --connection-string $AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
````

Get storage account key. This will be needed for the pod to access the storage.

````
STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --account-name <unique name for storage account> --query "[0].value" -o tsv)
````

Validate that the environment variable was correctly populated, by echoing the content. 

````
echo  $STORAGE_KEY
````

Create a kubernetes secret to hold the storage account name and key. Like in the previous example, this secret will be used by the pod.

````
kubectl create secret generic azure-secret --from-literal=azurestorageaccountname=<unique name for storage account> --from-literal=azurestorageaccountkey=$STORAGE_KEY
````

Now you need to edit the manifest once again. You need to add two things, a ````volume```` definition and a ````volumeMount````

For the volumeMount, change the following:

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
        volumeMounts:
        - name: disk
          mountPath: "/mnt/azuredisk"

```

to look like below (in other words, add the volumeMount at the end of the ````containers```` section)

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: azure-vote-front
        image: <your unique ACR name>.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
        volumeMounts:
        - name: disk
          mountPath: "/mnt/azuredisk"
        - name: azure
          mountPath: "/mnt/azure"
```

For the ````volume```` definition, add the following at the very end of the ````deployment```` section for ````azure-vote-front````, after the ````env```` section. If you already have  `volume` section from the previous exercises, just add the missing parts (there should be only one volume segment, which can contain multiple volumes) 

### Note: Make sure indentation is correct. YAML is really picky when it comes to that. The ````volumes```` statement should be on the same indentation level as the ````containers```` statement

````
  volumes:
  - name: disk
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: azure-managed-disk
  - name: azure
    csi:
      driver: file.csi.azure.com
      readOnly: false
      volumeAttributes:
        secretName: azure-secret
        shareName: <file share name>
````

Now its time to apply the manifest again:

````
kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
````

After some time, you can once again ````exec```` into the container to make sure that the volume is where it should be

````
kubectl exec -ti <pod name> -- sh
ls -l /mnt/azure
````

While inside the pod, you could create a file in the file share, e.g. by doing

````
touch /mnt/azure/hello.txt
````

If you want to, you can now go into the Azure portal and browse to the resource group you created. Then click on the "Storage Account" resource. When the storage account blade opens up, you can select "File shares" in the left hand navigation bar. When you click file shares, you will see the file share you created previously. Go into that file share, and select "Overview" from the left hand navigation. When you do, you should see the file you just created in the pod (hello.txt).

Another way of checking the mount is to use ````kubectl describe```` (if you are still attached to the pod, make sure to exit back to the cloud shell before running the command)

````
kubectl describe pod <pod name>
````

In the output you will find (among other things) that you have a mount at /mnt/azure.
